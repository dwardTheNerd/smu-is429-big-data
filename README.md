# Edward's Big Data Cloud Computing Problem

## Introduction
As part of my SMU IS429 assignment, I am tasked to search for my own dataset and process it using available cloud resources.

## Datasets
For this assignment, I have decided to scrape data from Steam's API. The scraping process produced 3 csv files:
* [players.csv](https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/smu-is429-steam/data/players/players.csv)
* [games.csv](https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/smu-is429-steam/data/games/games.csv)
* [game_stats.csv](https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/smu-is429-steam/data/game_stats/game_stats.csv)
